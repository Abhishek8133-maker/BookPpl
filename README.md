## Overview

**BookPpl** is a community-focused platform designed to revolutionize the way people connect with books and knowledge. Our mission is to bridge gaps in book accessibility, foster meaningful discussions, and empower communities to share learning resources regardless of background or means.

## Vision

We envision a world where:
- Access to books is democratized and available to everyone.
- Readers can easily share, exchange, and discover books.
- Knowledge is not hoarded, but freely circulated and discussed.
- Communities unite not just around genres, but around the love of learning.

## Key Features

- **Book Sharing Network**: Easily lend, borrow, or exchange books with people in your community.
- **Discovery Engine**: Intelligent recommendations based on your interests, reading habits, and trending books in your area.
- **Community Reviews & Discussions**: Rate, review, and discuss books and authors with fellow readers.
- **Reading Challenges & Events**: Join or create book clubs, reading challenges, and local events.
- **Personal Library Management**: Track your owned, borrowed, and wishlist books in one place.
- **Inclusive Design**: Accessibility-first interface for users of all abilities.
- **Notifications & Updates**: Stay informed about new books, events, and community posts.

## Tech Stack

BookPpl is currently under development. The proposed tech stack includes:

- **Frontend**: React.js / Next.js for a dynamic, responsive user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for robust API design
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for scalable data storage
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0, JWT for secure login and community features
- **Hosting**: Vercel, Netlify, or AWS
- **Other Tools**: TypeScript, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Socket.io for real-time features
